When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--- In every project that would be too tough to manage. It will be a great place to backup projects. It can also mean that you can access
your project from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--- Only if there is a situation when you are working with a team and a team member placed an unfinished file in the repository. Otherwise, if I were working on a project alone, I wouldn't mind automatic pulls.
