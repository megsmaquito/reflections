What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-- It gets the folder ready for commit. So that we could track the changes we make in our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-- The staging area holds the files that will be included in the repository. You can change your mind in case you want to add or remove files in the staging area before you put them in the repository.
