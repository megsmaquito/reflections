How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

--I could revert back to a previous version of code that was actually headed towards the right direction. I could easily compare changes.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-- It will develop a good habit for coding. It will be committing a usable code and knowing pretty much what changed


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-- Git is made with a developer in mind wherein a single app can have multiple interellated files. Google Docs is mainly used for single documents like spreadsheets, texts, etc.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-- cd into the repository folder, use git log to see the different commits and messages. Then, git diff will be used to see the details of the changes i.e. deleted lines and added lines.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

--I could easiy find which commit has the bug, do a git diff of that commit and the previous one to see what changed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
--I could clone repositories from the github.
