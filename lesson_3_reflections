When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--- In every project that would be too tough to manage. It will be a great place to backup projects. It can also mean that you can access
your project from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--- Only if there is a situation when you are working with a team and a team member placed an unfinished file in the repository. Otherwise, if I were working on a project alone, I wouldn't mind automatic pulls.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--- A fork is getting an existing repository and putting it in one's own. A clone is copying a repository from GitHub into a local computer. A branch is a commit which is not on the master branch but branching out of a master branch. Changes in a new branch will not affect the master branch and vice-versa.
