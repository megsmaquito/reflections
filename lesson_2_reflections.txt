What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-- It gets the folder ready for commit. So that we could track the changes we make in our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-- The staging area holds the files that will be included in the repository. You can change your mind in case you want to add or remove files in the staging area before you put them in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

-- With git diff --staged, you'll be able to find out which lines you are about to commit -- that is the file(s) you added already to the staging area. With git status, you'll be able to find out what changes you have done so far.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

-- If you want to do an experimental feature on the program. Specially, if the team does not quite approve of the experimental feature. It will not touch the main branch which the team has worked on. Later on if the branch or experiment you created is approved and stable, you could merge it with the main branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

-- With diagrams, I'll be able to tell which is the main branch and which are the other branches. It will be easier to see how I can reach certain commits on other branches.
